    "description": "An exceptional example of one of Mayfair's original Mansions, this Grade II listed townhouse was constructed in 1732 and extensively refurbished in 1908 by famed British Architect Ralph Knott. Today the house has been restored to its former glory, respectful of its history but very much with modern qualities.
    Spanning over 14,500 sq ft and with grand proportions throughout including an 'L-shaped' drawing room on the first floor leading to a large terrace and a dining room on the ground floor with seating for twenty guests, the house is ideally configured for both formal entertaining and comfortable family living.
    
    The centrepiece of the house is the family kitchen, unusually positioned on the ground floor (supported by a 'dirty kitchen' on the lower ground floor), where families can meet and congregate. As well as the formal rooms, the main house has five principle bedroom suites including the master bedroom which occupies the entire second floor and has its own private and secluded roof terrace. Further bedrooms are found in the generously proportioned 'Mews House' to the rear in Culross Street which has its own drawing room/kitchen as well as a well-appointed gym and garaged parking for two cars.
    
    The main house has an enviable spa with one of Mayfair's largest private swimming pools, a gym/fitness studio, separate spa pool, sauna and for post work-out relaxation a private screening room.",

    "description": "'A very rare Freehold mansion, nestled in a double-width garden, available for sale for the first time in 60 years.'

    We are privileged to introduce this unique property, which offers the fortunate buyer a rare combination of privacy and grand living, in one of London's most sophisticated leafy villages.
    
    This remarkable, freehold neo-Georgian mansion is in a delightful and convenient position on the corner of Radlett Place and Avenue Road, opposite the junction of Acacia Road and makes an impressive statement in the road.
    
    The sense of grandeur becomes apparent when considering the dimensions, which are approximately twice the width of most other properties in the road (Width: 128ft/38.8m and Depth: 139 ft/42.3m). While the site covers a total area of 0.41 acres (0.17 hectares), with Radlett Place on one side, it is therefore a substantial distance from its neighbours.",
